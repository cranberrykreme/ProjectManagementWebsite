# ProjectManagementWebsite

This is my Continual Professional Development (CPD) project for COMP4060, my plan is to make a website and have users be able to create action items, to then move from ToDo -> Started -> Continuing -> Reviewing -> Finished -> Archived tabs. 

This will be taken step by step starting with a very simple static website and then continuing along to a more advanced project.
